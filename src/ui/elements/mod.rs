//! Sub-modules for individual UI panels, toolbars, and dialog widgets.
//!
//! Each module owns exactly one public `draw_*` function that returns an
//! `egui::Rect` describing the area it occupies.  This makes it easy for
//! `draw_ui()` to compute the canvas rect as the remaining space.
//!
//! [`bar_strip`] is the one piece shared between them: the layout the two bars
//! across the top of the window are laid out on.

/// Lay a bar's contents out on a strip that never narrows past what they need,

///
/// Blender's headers behave this way: a header that has run out of room stops
/// shrinking rather than letting what is on it run together, and the part that
/// falls off the end is reached by rolling the wheel over the bar. No
/// scrollbar is drawn - there is no room for one in a bar this shallow, and
/// the wheel is how Blender reaches it too - but egui's fade at the strip's
/// ends says which way there is more.
///
/// `add_contents` is handed the strip, which is `height` tall and as wide as
/// the bar or as wide as its contents need, whichever is more, and returns the
/// width they actually needed. That width is only known once they have been
/// laid out, so it is measured into the next frame, the way the viewport bar's
/// centre run is placed from its own last-frame width; a repaint is asked for
/// whenever it moves, so the strip is never left a frame behind what is on it.
///
/// The height is passed in rather than taken from the room the bar has,
/// because only one of the two bars is sized before its contents are: the
/// viewport bar hands down the height its panel was fixed at, the menu bar the
/// row height its own contents are centred on and grow out of.
