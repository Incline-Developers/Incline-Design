//! The Solids workspace's six-stage pipeline: what each stage needs, what it
//! produces, and whether what it produced is still current.
//!
//! The pipeline is *explicitly executed*. Opening a page, selecting a blast or
//! moving a camera never finishes a calculation; Run to Step and Run All do. What
//! a page does is show the stage status and the artifacts that are already
//! there, so a scheduler can consume a completed run without any page having
//! been opened at all.
//!
//! Stages run in a strict order and no stage may read a later stage's output:
//!
//! | Stage | Reads | Produces |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | Field List | The project's reserve fields | A validated schema |
//! | Block Models | The schema, each model's mapping and inclusion | Validated bindings and whole-model statistics |
//! | Solids | Those bindings, the solid definitions and their surfaces | Closed bodies, volumes and bounds |
//! | Benching | Completed bodies and the benching plan | Bench and flitch slabs, footprints, occupied bands |
//! | Blasting | Completed benches and their cut drawings | Blast partitions and committed names |
//! | Dig Strips | Completed blast and flitch partitions, strip drawings | Dig blocks with volumes and reserves |
//!
//! Each stage's input fingerprint includes the fingerprint of the stage before
//! it, so one edit marks exactly the suffix of stages it can reach. Camera,
//! hover and selection are not inputs to anything.
