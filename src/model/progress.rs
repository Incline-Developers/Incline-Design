//! Progress shared between a background worker and the status bar.
//!
//! A [`Progress`] is created on the UI thread, cloned into the worker, and
//! sampled once per frame by the status bar. Reports are plain atomic stores,
//! so a worker can call them inside a tight loop without coordinating with the
//! UI thread; the reader only ever needs the latest value, never the history.
//!
//! Work whose size is known ahead of time reports item counts
//! ([`Progress::set_items`]) and drives an exact percentage. Work that runs in
//! stages of differing cost splits the bar into [`Phase`]s, each reporting
//! exactly within its own slice - the percentage is then exact inside a stage
//! and approximate between stages, which is the best a staged pipeline can do.
//! Work that can't measure itself at all stays indeterminate and the status bar
//! shows a marquee.
