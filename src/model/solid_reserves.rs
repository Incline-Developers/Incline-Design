//! Volume-prorated reserves for closed planning slabs.
//!
//! The input contract is a *partition*, not a flat list of slabs. Planning
//! divides a solid vertically into bands - benches, then the flitches inside
//! them - and then divides each band laterally into blasts and dig blocks. The
//! vertical bands are ordered and never overlap, but two dig blocks in one
//! flitch share that band's elevations exactly. Flattening both levels into one
//! ordered list is impossible, which is why [`ReservePartition`] keeps them
//! apart: bands carry the ordering, pieces carry the lateral split.
