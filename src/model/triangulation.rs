/// A persistent version of one source surface's *geometry*.

/// The rules live here so no caller has to remember them:
///
/// - A token is minted once, when an item's geometry first becomes known -
///   at import, at generation, or at load for an older file that never
///   carried one - and is [`Copy`]: everything downstream of it, including
///   schedule references, holds it by value.
/// - Nothing but a change of geometry may mint a new one. Colour, name,
///   visibility, loading state and rendering caches leave it alone, so a
///   token that survives says the ground it names was not redrawn.
/// - It is persisted with the item (OMF element metadata), and eviction
///   round-trips through those same bytes, so a restore hands back the token
///   that left.
/// - Undo of a geometry edit must restore the earlier token with the earlier
///   geometry; an edit after that undo mints a fresh one, so a redo cannot
///   resurrect the retired version. When mesh editing arrives, its commit
///   path mints here and marks the item dirty - nothing else.
///
/// Tokens are UUID v4, minted through the same browser-capable mechanism as
/// [`crate::model::project::ProjectId`]: random, not derived from the clock,
/// pointers, runtime ids or the general item epoch, so two sessions minting
/// concurrently cannot hand each other's token out by construction of the
/// random source rather than by timing assumptions. Random is not "cannot
/// collide" - a v4 collision needs the same 122 random bits twice - but it
/// is the same guarantee every id in the project already stands on.
